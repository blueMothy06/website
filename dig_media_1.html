  Online communication is how most of us talk to other people these days. 
  It is lacking in a physical form and a lot of the experience is meeting 
  people is lost through a screen. However, despite the limitations that
  the lockdown has placed on us, I managed to make some close friends
  that I don't think I would've made, if the pandemic had not happened.
  This picture depicts a flower growing out a phone screen, under an
  artifical light, which reflects how even geniune friendship can
  blossom in this environment.
