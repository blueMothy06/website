<h1>Twine Project</h1>
<img src = "img15.png" class="center"/>
<p><b>(Temporarily) Finished: March/April 2021</b>
  <br>
  This is a Twine project that I had not completed. It's inspired by <i>A Man Outside</i>, but has its own
  storyline and secrets.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Premise: </b>You have moved into your new house. Everything seems to be fine and dandy, until you realize that
  your neighbor won't stop staring at your window. No matter what you do, they will remain there.
